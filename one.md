Welcome! In this blog post, we will be discussing the basic filesystem commands `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. Each command will be shown in situations where there are no arguments, a path to a directory as an argument, and a path to a file as an argument

## `cd` Command

>Example 1: Using the command with no arguments

Command: `cd`

Working Directory: `/home`

Explanation: `cd` with no arguments can have different results given its current working directory. If the current working directory is `/home`, it will change from `/home` to `/home` in the command prompt, essentially not changing the command prompt. `cd` does not have output.

Scenario 2:

Working Directory: `/salutations`

Explanation: If the current working directory is a repository or file, `cd` will change the current working directory to `/home` in the command prompt. `cd` does not have output.

Example 2: Using the command with a path to a *directory* as an argument

Command: `cd (directory name)`
