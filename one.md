Welcome! In this blog post, we will be discussing the basic filesystem commands `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. Each command will be shown in situations where there are no arguments, a path to a directory as an argument, and a path to a file as an argument

>`cd`:

`cd` with no arguments can have different results given its current working directory. For example, if the current working directory is /home, it will change from /home to /home, thus `cd` will give no output.
